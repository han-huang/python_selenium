# Selenium 3.X is no longer capable of running Selenium RC directly, rather it does it through emulation and the WebDriverBackedSelenium interface.

# Download version 3.11.0

# Update

# You are using Selenium's version 3.+

# As it reads here https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/selenium-3-0-out-now/

# The major change in Selenium 3.0 is weâ€™re removing the original Selenium Core implementation and replacing it with one backed by WebDriver. This will affect all users of the Selenium RC APIs.

# This is very likely the reason why your code is not working anymore. You have two solutions. Either you downgrade your version of selenium (which is rarely a good idea), or you must re-develop a new testing framework which works with this new version.
